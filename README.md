# Machine Learning Algorithms
This is a collation of typical data science and machine learning algorithms coded in Python (or the occassional other language). My current project Ephm3ralMusic 
(see [here](https://www.jadesolabejide.dev/portfolio/#/projects)) will feature different implementations of these various algorithms to inform user music recommendations.
